Each folder refers to a specific noise.
Given I = uint8(image);
MODELS_GAUSS_001 = imnoise(I,'gaussian',0,0.01);
MODELS_GAUSS_002 = imnoise(I,'gaussian',0,0.02);
MODELS_SPECKLE_005 = imnoise(I,'speckle',0.05);
MODELS_SPECKLE_010 = imnoise(I,'speckle',0.10);
MODELS_SALT&PEPPER = imnoise(I,'salt & pepper);
MODELS_POISSON = imnoise(I,'poisson');
MODELS_EXPONENTIAL_5 = uint8(double(I) + exprnd(5,size(I))
